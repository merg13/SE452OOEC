 * Abstract class that defines the base properties that all API Call Responses should have from the FlixNet server.
 * - utilizes Lombok @Data to generate getters and setters.
 * - @SuperBuilder experimental Lombok decorator is used so that classes that extend this abstract class get the initial properties in the fluent builder methods as well.
